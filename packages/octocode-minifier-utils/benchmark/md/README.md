| Tool | Bytes | Cut | Time | Rating |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| input | 3304 | - | - | - |
| content-view | 3303 | 0% | 0.327 ms | 5.5/10 |

## Agent Understanding

Measured from `standard` minified output.

| Component | Score |
| --- | ---: |
| syntax anchors | 10/10 (3/3) |
| delimiter structure | 10/10 |
| output health | 10/10 |
| context budget | 5/10 |
| symbol context | 7/10 |
| signals passed | 6/6 |

## Agent Observation By Output Level

Ratings are computed from the actual raw, standard, minify, and symbol outputs
for this language sample.

| Level | Bytes | Cut | Agent observation | Syntax anchors | Structure |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| none | 3304 | 0% | 10/10 excellent | 10/10 | 10/10 |
| standard | 3303 | 0% | 9.2/10 excellent | 10/10 | 10/10 |
| minify | 3303 | 0% | 9.2/10 excellent | 10/10 | 10/10 |
| symbols | 3489 | -5.6% | 6.3/10 fair | 3.3/10 | 10/10 |

## Notes

- markdown text strategy.
- content-view kept original because the readable output was not shorter.
- symbols are not implemented for this extension.

22| ## Why Rust?
24| - **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages.
26| - **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.
28| - **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool ([Cargo]), auto-formatter ([rustfmt]), linter ([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
